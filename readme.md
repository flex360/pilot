# Getting Started
When starting from a fresh Laravel install:

	* Delete the users table migration (if migrations have never been run)

	* Remove the welcome route

	* Make sure you have run `npm install && npm run dev`

Install: `composer require flex360/pilot`

Database: Update the .env file with database credentials.
