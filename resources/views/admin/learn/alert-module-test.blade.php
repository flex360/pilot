<h2>Construction Zone</h2>

<p>We&#39;re testing our alert module for a client and showing that the announcement doesn&#39;t show up on the page that it links to. <em>If you are seeing the announcement at the top of this page, that means we&#39;re currently working on it.</em></p>

<h3>No announcement at the top?</h3>

<p>Then it&#39;s working properly and will be deactivating this announcement shortly!</p>
